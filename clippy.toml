# Clippy Configuration for CueDeck
# Enforces code complexity metrics to maintain code quality

# Maximum cognitive complexity (unified metric replacing both cyclomatic and cognitive)
# Measures how hard code is to understand
# Default: 25, we use 25 to make it explicit
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 25

# Maximum lines per function
# Default: 100, we make it explicit
too-many-lines-threshold = 100
